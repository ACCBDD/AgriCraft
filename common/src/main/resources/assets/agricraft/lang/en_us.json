  "agricraft.journal.introduction.paragraph_2": "When analyzing the genome of a seed, you learn one or two things about it, such as what kind of environments it likes, how it will grow, what fruits it might bear, and to and from which other species it might mutate.",

  "agricraft.journal.crop_breeding.paragraph_1": "To cross-breed two plants, they must be planted on crop sticks, with one block space in between. Place double crop sticks on this spot in the middle.",

  "agricraft.journal.crop_breeding.paragraph_3": "The plant DNA, its genome, defines the species and stats of a plant. A genome consists of a set of gene pairs, which give rise to the traits of the plants. It is one gene of each of these pairs that is passed on to offspring, resulting in a new gene pair. Be wary however, every time this happens, there is a chance for a mutation to occur, as is illustrated above.",

  "agricraft.journal.stats.strength": "Stronger plants will be more resilient with regards to environmental conditions and will be able to grow in more hostile environments.",
  "agricraft.journal.stats.resistance": "This is the plant's resistance against weeds, a higher resistance stat will result in lower chances of weeds sprouting and killing the host plant.",
  "agricraft.journal.stats.fertility": "Governs the fertility of the plant, a higher fertility will increase the plant's probability to cross-breed with other plants and create progeny.",

  "agricraft.journal.growth_reqs": "Growth Requirements",
  "agricraft.journal.growth_reqs.paragraph_1": "Each plant has a different set of growth requirements which define where it is fertile and can grow, this includes brightness, soil properties, and more.
